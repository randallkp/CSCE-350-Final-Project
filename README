syntax: sorts <input file>

sample input data is provided in data_small.txt, data_med.txt, and data_large.txt

This program takes a set of integers as input data, and compares the performance of
quicksort and mergesort on already sorted, reverse sorted, and randomly sorted sets
of the input data. Performance is measured in time to completion of sort.

output should look something like this.

sort type	presort		input size	cycles to sort
quicksort	sorted		100		1000
mergesort	sorted		100		1000
quicksort	reverse		100		1000
mergesort	reverse		100		1000
quicksort	random		100		1000
mergesort	random		100		1000


To run program on all 3 data sets, use the run_tests shell script.
