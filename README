syntax: sorts <input file>

sample input data is provided in data.txt

This program takes a set of integers as input data, and compares the performance of
quicksort and mergesort on already sorted, reverse sorted, and randomly sorted sets
of the input data. Performance is measured in time to completion of sort.

output should look something like this.

sort		data set	set size	time to sort
quicksort	sorted		100		1s
mergesort	sorted		100		1s
quicksort	reverse		100		2s
mergesort	reverse		100		2s
quicksort	random		100		3s
mergesort	random		100		3s
